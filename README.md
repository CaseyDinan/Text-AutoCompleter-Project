# Text-AutoCompleter-Project
The object of this project was to use large branching factor tries to create the backend of a text autocompleter feature. The test file for this program is App.java, which has been written to demonstrate the utility of the features. For any questions on the code, feel free to reach out to me at cdd43@pitt.edu.
